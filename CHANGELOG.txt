# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
The date format is YYYY-MM-DD. The version format is X.Y.Z.

## [0.2.0] - 2020-08-11

### Added -
- Flask Integration
- HTML, CSS
- videoEditor.py

### Changed - 
- Nearly everything.

### Notes -
I haven't been maintaining the changelog, as most of my development was local. I'll be working to 
keep better track as of now, and for each merge to this repository I'll make notes in here about it.
Regarding the last note, input validation has been implemented.

## [0.1.2] - 2020-07-22

### Added -
- Imported moviepy 
- Added clip_data value 'filename'

### Changed - 
- Optimized validateClips()
- Reformatted Twitch method names and calls to make more sense.

### Notes - 
There's no input validation for the Twitch parameters. I should have some indication at
least for the filter, because that relies on pre-defined keywords. There also isn't 
custom directory implementation -- I'll get that put in tomorrow.


## [0.1.1] - 2020-07-20

### Added - 
- Implemented method t.generateEmbed()


## [0.1.0] - 2020-07-19 

### Added -
- Implemented clip validation through t.validateClips()
- Implemented clip value ['clip_valid']
- Created t.downloadClips()
- Added t.print() function in class Twitch to print values in a given clip_data dict.

### Changed - 
- Moved testing code into function v.downloadClips in class Video.

### Notes -
The current implementation of validating clips is atrocious from a user standpoint.
All of the clip thumbnails are opened one by one, and they can't be closed as of yet. This will be much
better once the PyQT GUI is implemented, but for now it's pretty terrible.
I think I'll move on to PyQT implementation tomorrow. As of now, the program is capable of a full
retrieval and download of clips given a certain game, so I want a proper GUI before I move on to
concatenation and intro/outro.
